\title{Differentially Private Plotting Frame for 2D Projections}
\usage{
dp_frame(X, eps_q, delta_q, inflate = 0.1, q = NULL, clip_to_data_range = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix with exactly two columns representing the 2D
projected data (e.g., PC1 and PC2 scores).}

\item{eps_q}{Privacy budget \eqn{\varepsilon_q} allocated for estimating the
minimum and maximum (split equally between lower and upper quantiles).}

\item{delta_q}{Privacy parameter \eqn{\delta_q} for the smooth-sensitivity
quantile estimator (also split equally).}

\item{inflate}{A non-negative numeric value indicating how much wider the
DP frame should be relative to the DP min--max interval. A value of
\code{inflate = 0.10} enlarges the interval by 10\\%.}

\item{q}{Optional symmetric quantile level in \eqn{(0,1)}. If provided, the
function uses the \eqn{q}- and \eqn{1-q}-quantiles instead of the extreme
order statistics \eqn{1/n} and \eqn{(n-1)/n}. Useful for robustness when
the data contain extreme outliers.}

\item{clip_to_data_range}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, privatized quantiles are
clipped to remain within the empirical data range.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\itemize{
\item \code{xlim}: A numeric vector of length 2 giving the DP x-axis limits.
\item \code{ylim}: A numeric vector of length 2 giving the DP y-axis limits.
}
}
\description{
Constructs a differentially private plotting frame (x- and y-limits) for
2-dimensional data projected onto principal component axes. The frame is
created using differentially private estimates of the minimum and maximum
values based on smooth sensitivity.
}
\details{
To ensure differential privacy, the function first flattens the 2D input
matrix \code{X} into a vector and estimates privatized lower and upper
quantiles via \code{dp_quantile_ss()}, using the smooth sensitivity method
of Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith (2007). The resulting DP min and max are
symmetrized to obtain a center point and half-length, which is optionally
expanded by the multiplicative factor \code{1 + inflate}.

The returned \code{xlim} and \code{ylim} limits are identical, ensuring that
the plotting frame remains square—important for PCA score plots.
