\title{Recommend the Number of Histogram Bins for 2D DP Visualization}
\usage{
number_bins(X, method = c("W", "J"))
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame or matrix with \eqn{n} rows representing observations.
Only the number of rows is used; the dimensionality of \code{X} is ignored,
but the heuristics are intended for 2D visualizations.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the bin selection method.
Either \code{"W"} (Wasserman) or \code{"J"} (Jing).}
}
\value{
An integer giving the suggested number of bins for each axis.
}
\description{
Computes a recommended number of bins per axis for 2-dimensional
differentially private histograms, using heuristics proposed in the
literature. The function supports two methods:
\itemize{
\item \code{"W"}: Wasserman's rule-of-thumb for 2D histograms,
yielding \eqn{m_{\text{axis}} \asymp n^{1/4}}.
\item \code{"J"}: Jing's log-based rule,
yielding \eqn{m_{\text{axis}} \asymp (n / \log n)^{1/3}}.
}
}
\details{
For 2D histograms, if the total number of bins scales as
\eqn{m_{\text{total}} \asymp n^{1/2}}, then the number of bins per axis is
\eqn{m_{\text{axis}} \asymp n^{1/4}} (Wasserman, 2010).

Alternatively, Jing's criterion derives a bandwidth
\eqn{h \asymp (\log n / n)^{1/3}}, implying that the number of bins per axis is
\eqn{m_{\text{axis}} \asymp (n / \log n)^{1/3}}.

Because these formulas often underestimate the optimal visual smoothness,
practitioners frequently choose slightly larger values than the recommendation.
