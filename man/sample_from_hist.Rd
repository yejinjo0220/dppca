\title{Sample Synthetic Points From a DP Histogram}
\usage{
sample_from_hist(X, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame representing a 2D histogram. It must contain the
following columns:
\code{xmin}, \code{xmax}, \code{ymin}, \code{ymax}, \code{prob},
where \code{prob} denotes the noisy bin probability.}

\item{k}{Integer; the number of synthetic points to generate.}
}
\value{
A data frame with \code{k} rows and two columns:
\code{x} and \code{y}, representing the sampled 2D points.
}
\description{
Generates synthetic 2D samples by drawing from a differentially private
histogram. Each histogram bin is selected according to its (normalized)
probability mass, and the returned points are sampled uniformly within
the corresponding rectangular bin.
}
\details{
The function first normalizes the (possibly unnormalized) histogram
probabilities to form a valid discrete distribution. Then, \code{k} bins
are drawn with replacement according to these probabilities. For each
selected bin, a point is sampled uniformly from the rectangle
\eqn{[x_{\min}, x_{\max}] \times [y_{\min}, y_{\max}]}.

This allows the user to visualize or analyze the distribution implied by a
DP histogram without directly exposing individual (private) data points.
